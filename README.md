	<summary>Importance score for each variable</summary><br>
	<p>The variable importance score in the context of the random forest algorithm indicates the importance of each
	feature (variable) in predicting the target variable, which, in this case, is the price of the car. In other words, a variable 
	is considered important if removing it from the model results in worse predictions. The importance of the variable is calculated 
	for all trees in the forest and then the average is taken 5.</p>
